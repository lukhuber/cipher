# Roadmap
This is a incomplete list of all the features I want to include into a specific version, before I bump to the next version. It basically serves me as a guide, to focus on specific features, as I otherwise tend to work on this codebase rather aimlessly. 

## v0.0.4
- Intelligent worker count management
- BUG REMOVAL: Harvester throwing error on its first tick

## v0.0.5
- Set sign in every occupied room

## v0.1
- Full automatic bunker planning and building for the first room
