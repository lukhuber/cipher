# Roadmap
This is a incomplete list of all the features I want to include into a specific version, before I bump to the next version. It basically serves me as a guide, to focus on specific features, as I otherwise tend to work on this codebase rather aimlessly.

- Logic to use containers at mining sites

## v0.0.6

- Visualisation of every path, with color coding

## v0.1.0

- BUG REMOVAL: Harvester throwing error on its first tick

## v0.2.0
- Scouting and harvesting neighbouring rooms

## v0.3.0
